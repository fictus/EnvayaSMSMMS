EnvayaSMS to allow sending MMS files

Old code I modified back in 2021 to allow sending MMS files.

WARNING! I am not a Java developer so my code changes are very buggy. This project needs love from a true Java developer - you have been warned.




EnvayaSMS is an Android app that acts as a SMS and MMS gateway.
